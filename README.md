# Assembly Examples


Some small examples of Assembly code compiled from C, with explanations of the core part of the Assembly, useful to understand the basics of assembly instruction.
Also, Assembly codes of the same C program compiled with different optimization levels are discussed.

## Repository Structure

- `addition`: Adding two integers
- `multiplication`: Multiplying two integers
- `addition_prin `: Adding two integers and print the result

## Running the examples

You need a compiler such as `gcc`.
To run an example:
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder of the example.
2. Assemble and link the code (Here we'll use `gcc` but you can use the compiler you prefer, with its syntax)
```bash
gcc example.s -o example
```
3.Execute with
 ```bash
 ./example
```
